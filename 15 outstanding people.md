# Outstanding people

#### 1. What is to be outstanding, to your mind?

In my opinion, to be an outstanding person means to not to be like anymore else and being someone who is not trying to emphasize it. An outstanding person is the one who wants to do something good and make people happy. A great number of remarkable people surround us and we may not even know about it. You can do everything by themselves.

For example, Americans ate very proud of Bill Gated and they consider him an outstanding person. He was able to create something from nothing. We have to live out lives to be respected and to help people, that will make an outstanding person form each of us.

#### 5. Is it an advantage to be famous?

It's difficult to speak about famous people as little information about their biography is not enough to understand what kind of people they were. For me it's  easier to talk about my friends or someone I know, for example, about my photography teacher. 

I'm have become is all thanks to him. He is the person who helps everyone and never asks anything in return. Thanks to him I loved art and photography. I found my current best friends with same hobby. He changed my life and I respect him very much.
