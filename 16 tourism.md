#### 1. Why do people travel?

I must say, that noawdays the motivation for travelling is different. If you want to experience some new environment, to see new places and meet new people, travelling is the right way. Travelling on business allows people to get more information about achievement of other companies and help them make their own business more successful. Some people travel for educational purposes. Rich o poor, old or young, they want to leave the place where they live or work to have a rest. It is always interesting to discover new things and other ways of life. Travelling is a remarkable key to understanding other cunlures, a wonderful opporunity to learn more about the world where we live.

#### 2. What means of transport do you prefer and why?

Nowadays peope can travel in different ways. People usually travel by air, by rain, by sea or by road. All means of travel have advantages and disadvantages.

As for me I prefer travelling by car. I think it's very convenient. You don't depend on the timetable. You are free to stop and change the direction whenewer you want. You can take a break for a picnic if you feel hungry.

#### 3. What questions would you ask a tour guide on a tour of London?

1. Do I need a passport or visa?

2. I wonder, how much it will cost?
3. Is simmer the best time to travel there?
4. It will take me a lot of thime t get the destination, willn't it?

5. What excursions are included into the tour?

#### 4. You have visited some foreign countries. Which of them did you like most and would you recommend your friend to visit?

1. If you like nature you should go to Finland.
2. If you are interested in history, I advise you to visit Italy or Greece.
3. If you want to have fun, I recommend travelling to Las Vegas in the USA.
4. If you want to see beautiful buildings, you had better travel to Paris.

#### 5. What difficulties can you have when visiting a foreign country? Is it possible to avoid them?

Vitising a forighn country, people usually come in touch with culture, traditions and ways different from their own. Visitors should show respect fot the other culture and its traditions. In this way it will possible to avoid difficulties. I'm sure that having a good command of a foreign language, particulary English, is a must.
