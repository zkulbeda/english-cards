#### 5. Nowadays more and more people are getting interested in customs and traditions of different countries. What do you think about it?

"So many countries, so many customs" an English proverb says.

By comparing customs and cultures of people from other countries, we can learn
how others view the world and why there think the way they do. By understanding
others, we can learn more about ourselves and our culture.
