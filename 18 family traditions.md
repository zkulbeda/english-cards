The answer is lost.

#### 1. Let's talk about family traditions. How often does your entire family gather together?

Every summer we go to the country together to relax and fun. Like usual family, we have traditions too. But to put our family together is hard enough just because one of the my grannies live far away and we can't meet as often as we want. As for the rest of my family? they are also involved into their own family life routine, but we try to arrange our big meeting at least once or twice a year, mostly in summer, at my grandparents' dacha to enjoy all time together.

#### 2. Is it hard to maintain good family relations?

In my opinion if you want to have a tight-knit family you should respect and support your partner, you should be understanding, friendly, tolerant, polite. Both parents should be involved in childcare. The members of the family should always communicate with each other. If they don't see eye to eye on some things, they should discuss it. Moreover, the members of the family should share joys and sadness. If you form and keep your family traditions it will do your family a lot of good. The members of the family should appreciate what they do for each other and be grateful to each other.

#### 3. What questions will you ask your friend about eating habits in his/her family.

1. You cook national dishes at home, don't you?
2. What is your favorite dish?
3. Do you eat a lot of junk or healthy food?
4. What dish do you always cook for a family meetings?
5. What does your usual breakfast consist of?

#### 4. Give some tips on how to prepare a big family gathering.

1. I advise you to thing about the event itself to arrange a place for it.
2. You should make the list of your guests.
3. I recommend making up the menu.
4. Don't forget about your children's spending time.
5. You had better take happy mood with you, and I'm sure your family gathering will be a success.

#### 5. What can you advise a boy whose elder brother is constantly teasing hum?

Teasing is just one of those thing that happens between siblings. And it is completely normal. May be in such a specific way they try to show their feelings. So if you don't like that? you can tell your elder brother that his teasing hurts your feelings. To my mind teasing will never end. It is just the case of your attitude to it. The more you pay attention to it, the more you will be teased. At least it will be good to learn how protect yourself. As soon as you both get older the way of your communication will change for the better, I hope.
