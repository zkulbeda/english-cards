National character and stereotypes
==================================

#### 1. They say every nation has got its national traits. What about Belarusians? What are our national traits?

Belarusian traditions and features of the national character was formed in the
cause of complex history. The country was involved in many military conflicts.

Unlike everyone else, Belarusians are extremely sociable and always enjoy
receiving guests and are perfect of this. New Belarusians prefer intellectual
jobs. They earn their living by using such features of character as tolerance,
but they are not materialistic. And one more thing, Belarusians are able to
adapt to any environment.

I have only touched on a few points. There is much more but that would take a
whole book to describe.

#### 2. Are Belarusian similar to Americans? Tell me about American values and beliefs.

No, isn't it. The United States has often been called a melting pot. This term
refers to the idea that the country is a place where people from many lands have
come together and formed a unified culture. Americans have many things in
common.

At the center of all Americans value is freedom. They belief that all people are
equal. So that they commonly regard their society as the best in the world.

Also, Americans often move from place to place with the sense of optimism. They
buy a house and them reselling it each time when they move.

#### 3. What question would you ask your Americans friend going to live and work in his/her country?

1.  What makes Americans different from other nations?

2.  Americans feel patriotic, doesn't they?

3.  Is football their favorite sport?

4.  What stereotypes connected with Americans do you know?

5.  How often Americans move from place to place?

#### 4. Your friend is going to study in America. Advise him/her how to communicate with Americans.

1.  You should be comfortable and relaxed like Americans, but not be
    disrespectful.

2.  I recommend always being polite about words you say and trying avoid
    commands.

3.  You can interrupt discussion when you have something important for you to
    say.

4.  I advise you to give Americans a lot of compliments. They like it.

#### 5. Do stereotypes connected with the British sound true?

The great British breakfast and afternoon tea are mostly found in hotels and
"bed and breakfast" places for tourists. It takes time to know a British person
well. British people are generally little shy and they do not make friends
easily. And they are not good at learning foreign languages. Most British people
spend less money on clothes than other people. And they still begin conversation
with the subject of the weather!
