Accommodation
=============

#### 1. What types of houses do people live in?

There are different types of houses. People can live in a detached house, in a
bungalow, in a cottage, in a flat in a block of flats.

Apartment of my dreams is a flat in a block of flats on upstairs. There are
bed-room, lounge, kitchen, bathroom. The lounge is very spacious. It has settee,
small table and TV. Windows is as tall as you stand and you can see beautiful
sea view through this window. The bed-room has big bed and desk that filled with
stuff. There are a computer and lump, for example. All rooms have a modern style
and conveniences. The rooms are white and some decorations give special taste.
All room are filled with smart things. You can control them with your
smartphone.

Well, those were my dreams. I just hope I get it one day.

#### 2. Would you like to have a house or a flat?

Well, I would like to have a big flat in the center of the city. Each way of
living has advantages. To my mind, a private flat has more pluses for living in
modern times.

#### 3. Ask me what my house/flat looks like

1.  Do you live in a house or a flat? What does it look like?

2.  How many rooms are there?

3.  You have your own room, haven't you?

4.  What colors are your rooms decorated in?

#### 4. Your relative wants to decorate his/her flat. Give him some advice on how to furnish it.

1.  First of all, start with choosing the colors you would like to have.

2.  You shouldn't buy everything at once.

3.  Try to decorate one room at a time.

4.  And last but not least, you must relax.

#### 5. They say that the room which you live in reflects your character and personality. What do you think about this idea?

I fully agree that the room you live in reflects your character and personality.
When you look around someone's room and pay attention to the way they decorated
it you can tell what their hobbies and interests are. For example, if someone
has a lot of films you can say that they enjoy movies. If you see a lot of
books, you can say that they are intelligent. If you see any posters you can
understand what actors and singers someone is crazy about.
