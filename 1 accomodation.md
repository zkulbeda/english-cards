#### 1. What types of houses do people live in?

There are different types of houses. People can live in a detached house, in a bungalow, in a cottage, in a flat in a block of flats.

Apartment of my dreams is a flat in a block of flats on upstairs. There are bed-room, lounge, kitchen, bathroom. The lounge is very spacious. It has settee? small table and TV. Windows is as tall as you stand and onto beautiful sea view. The bed-room has big bed and desk that filled with stuff. There are a computer and lump, for example, All rooms have a modern style and conveniences. The rooms are white and some decorations give special taste. All room are filled with smart things. You can control them with your smartphone.

Well, those were my dreams. I just hope I will get to have if one day.
