The role of book in our life is really great. Books help to understand people surrounding us better. Devoting much time to reading we become better informed and more educated. Also reading develops speech and helps me express my views, ideas in clean, simple words.

Reading isn't mmy hobby, but I like reading scientific and interesting articles for me on the Internet and book required for the school curriculum.

#### 4. What preferences do you have in music?

I think it's impossible to find someone who doensn't like any music. You can hardly see any teenager without earphones in his ears on the streets today. The world of music is varied and colorful. There is a great range of musical styles. Personally, I prefer electornic music. Words and meaning in music are not as important to me as melody. Good bits and waves ake me move and dance if i I'm in a good mood. Other kinds of music make me more foused and patient for work. I can't name my favorite artist because some of them have a lit of bad songs, but some songs are wonderful.
