# Art

#### 1. How important is art in our lives?

Art is everywhere around us in many forms. Broadly it is understood as a form to express someone's feelings through any object or medium like paper, music, photography. The way the room is decorated is art also.

Arts provide beauty in our world. Without beauty, there is no pleasure. Without pleasure, there is only discomfort and danger. People need beautiful things to look at, experience and enjoy. Last of them, art is a way of communication between an creator and the audience. Nowadays art and craft education are encouraged at school.

As for me, I am interested in photography. It is my hobby. I love to shoot amazing emotions and their story. What I specially like about photography is that one shot can touch people's feeling faster than words.

#### 2. Let's talk about people's reading preferences. What do you like reading?

The role of book in our life is really great. Books help to understand people surrounding us better. Devoting much time to reading we become better informed and more educated. Also reading develops speech and helps me express my views, ideas in clean, simple words.

Reading isn't my hobby, but I like reading scientific and interesting for me articles on the Internet and books required for the school curriculum (as I have to do it)

#### 3. What questions can you ask a British friend about his/her artistic preferences?

1. What arts are you interested in?
2. What kind of music do you like most?
3. Do you have a favorite singer or artist?
4. Are you like going to the cinema or prefer watching films at home?
5. What movies have you seen lately?
6. What is reading books for you?
7. What books you read?

#### 4. What kind of music do you recommend to me?

I think it's impossible to find someone who doesn't like any music. You can hardly see any teenager without earphones in his ears on the streets today. There is a great range of musical styles. Personally, I prefer electronic music and recommend you to listen to it. Words and meaning in music are not as important to me as melody. Good bits and waves make me move and dance if I I'm in a good mood. Other kinds of music, for example classical music, make me more concentrated and patient for work. I can't name my favorite musician because some of them have a lot of bad songs, but some songs are wonderful.

#### 5. Is cinema still important? Why(not)?

Cinema plays an important role in the life of any society. It is an available popular form of art. Lots of people find going to the cinema one of the best ways of spending their leisure time.

Also I must to say that movies are a powerful force in our modern world. Cinema is used in education. It helps to draw the attention of people to important global problems like environmental problems and tolerance.

In modern times, people began to use the Internet more often to watch movies at home. This is convenient, but not suitable for a large group of people.
