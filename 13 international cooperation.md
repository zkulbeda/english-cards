International cooperation
=========================

#### 1. What is international cooperation promoted for?

International relations have always been a significant part of the policy of the
Republic of Belarus. After becoming independent on 1991 Belarus has paid a lot
of attention to its foreign policy. Our country has become a member of various
international organizations. Belarus maintains diplomatic relations with 177
countries of the world. It encourages friendship between different cultures and
increases tourism. Minsk hosted junior Eurovision Song Contest, the second
European games and other events.

To conclude, I should say that modern Belarus is a sovereign European State with
a peaceful foreign policy.

#### 2. Is it important for Belarus to organize international events?

Undoubtedly, organizing international events is very important for our country.
It gives us an opportunity introduce our country in the world, promote our
culture. We can exchange experience, ask for help and gain new ideas.

#### 3. You are going to travel to Britain as an exchange student. Ask question about the exchange program?

1.  How can I apply for this program?

2.  Which documents do I need to submit?

3.  What requirements does it have for students?

4.  How much does it cost?

5.  I wonder if students can be provided with scholarships?

#### 4. Give advice to your friend who is hosting a foreign student.

1.  I advise him to make a foreign student feel welcome by introducing to his
    friends and family.

2.  You should involve you guest in household chores to feel part of the family.

3.  You had better think of the activities which can be interested for your
    guest.

4.  I recommend making his stay in Belarus unforgettable.

5.  It will be a good idea to learn about the social etiquette in the exchange
    student's country.

#### 5. ????

Everybody knows that social networking has got huge popularity nowadays. It hard
to find a person who doesn't have an account in Вконтакте, Instagram or Viber.
It's an instant and convenient means of communication. And it makes it really
easy to stay in touch with foreign friends. Thought, social networks have some
disadvantages too. They can't be compared with live communication after all. And
person in Internet can differ from a real one.
