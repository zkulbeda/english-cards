# Environment

#### 1. People say that out planet is in danger. Do you share this opinion?

Yes, I do. In modern times, the world's population has been growing very fast. People need more food, livestock, energy, but nothing can last forever. Many people don't understand it, and continue pollute the Earth with chemical elements. Moreover, there are other ecological problems. For example, greenhouse effect, deforestation, animal extinction. The greenhouse effect is the cause of climate changing, that changes a habitat of animals too, and because of that many of them may extinct. The main reason for greenhouse effect is plants and factories that emit tons[^1] of harmful substances in the atmosphere. People cut down forests although they throw away a lot of paper onto a landfill.

#### 2. Do you think people should protect the environment? What should they do?

People should understand that the planet need help if they want to survive and they should take measures to protect nature. First of all, they should understand that natural recourses are limited and we can't use them forever. You should recycle paper and cardboard to save trees

It would be much better if government also understand it and doing all possible to preserve the environment.

#### 3. What would you like to ask your British friend about measures that are taken to protect the environment in Britain?

1. I want to know, what measures are taken by your government to protect the environment?
2. There are some organizations in Britain that aim at nature protection, aren't there?
3. Do your mass media share knowledge on nature protection?
4. Do the British actively or passively take part in nature protection activities?

#### 4. A friend of yours wants to develop a program to protect the city where he lives. Give him a piece of advice.

1. I advice him to carry out research on the use of private cars and their bad influence on the atmosphere.
2. I recommend using that results to draw people's attention to the problem.
3. I think it would be a good idea to shoot video about animals and people's help to them

#### 5. An ideal Eco-House contest is held in the country and you want your school to enter it. Give some "green ideas" about houses.

It's difficult for people to change their habits to save the environment. I advice you to install underfloor heating, buy furniture made from recycled materials, consider investing in solar panels, monitor your electricity consumption, reduce, reuse and recycle.
