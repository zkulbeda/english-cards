#### 1. Let's talk about our country. What can you tell me about out Motherland?

Belarus is my Homeland. It's a country with a unique history and rich cultural
heritage. Officially it is called the Republic of Belarus, an independent state
with its own government, state emblem and flag.

Belarus is located nearly in the center of Europe. Its population is about 10
million people and territory about 208[^1] square kilometers. Belarus is made up
of six regions. The capital of Belarus is Minsk.

Belarus is a country of rivers. Lakes and forests. The longest river is Dnieper.
Lake Naroch is the largest lake. So, Belarus is often called the blue-eyes
country. Moreover, the climate is temperate and mild. Beautiful Belarusian
landscape and unique history attract a lot of tourists. Belarus is proud of its
hard-working and hospitable people, so I proud of my motherland too.
