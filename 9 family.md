Family
======

#### 1. What is family for you?

Family is very important for every person. My home is the best place to have
support and understanding. They are people whom you can trust and rely on, can
speak freely about my problems and share my joys.

In fact, I have a closer relationship with my mother. He always ready to try to
help me when I have difficulty.

Spending time together makes us closer to each other. My parents and I are
usually very busy during the weekdays. It's fortunate that we can talk about
events that happened earlier or will be.

Also, ones a week my mum tidies the flat. Of course, I help her with it, because
I understand that my family need my attention and support too. It's not so
boring if you turn on the music.

#### 2. Are you on good terms with your parents and grandparents?

Yes, I am. I enjoy honest relationship in my family. I like it, when parents
give me enough freedom. Sometimes we can disagree on certain issues, but there
is no so-called "generation gap" in our family.

#### 3. What would you ask your foreign friend about his relatives?

1.  Is your family big or little?

2.  Do you often visit your relatives?

3.  Who is closest to you?

4.  What family traditions do you have?

5.  You like spending your free time with your relatives, don't you?

#### 4. What can your advice people who want to have good relationships with their relatives?

You should always remember that they love you and mean the best to you. I
recommend being polite and not using harsh words. Make them realize that you
care for them. If you tidy up your room, do the washing up, do the cooking, you
will let your parents rest and make them happy.

#### 5. They say that parents and children have difficulties understanding each other because of generation gap. What do you think about thus problem?

Generation gap is some misunderstanding between parents and children, grown-up
and teenagers. We must do our best to understand each other, to be polite and
respect each other's opinion. In my family, my parents love mem understand me,
support me and in my turn, I do the same.
