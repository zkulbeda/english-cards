Future career
=============

#### 1. Let's talk about your future career. What kind of job would you like to have in future?

I must say that when you leave school you understand that the time to choose
your future profession has come. It's not easy to make right choice of a job.

When you choosing a future career, we should consider different factors. Money
is one of the most important factors when you make a choice. There are well-paid
jobs and low-paid jobs. I think everybody wants to earn as much money as
possible.

Anyway, many people choose profession according to their interests and
abilities. In my opinion, a job should be interesting and socially important.
You should also decide if you want to work indoors or outdoors.

It goes without saying that you should take into account your traits of
character. For example, to become a good doctor you must be patient, caring and
kind. Teacher's work requires love for children, good knowledge of subjects and
ability to explain.

I have always been interested in informatics and I am good at mathematics. I
have an ability for working with people. So, after finishing school I want to
enter the university and study programming.

#### 2. Do you want to have a part-time job, when you are a student? Why(not)?

There are some disadvantages to having a part-time job when you are a student as
well as some advantages. People often think that part-time jobs make a student
pay less attention to the studies. In my opinion, having a part-time job teaches
a student the importance of time management: that is combining work and studies
at the same time. Having a part-time job also teaches a person how to
communicate and interact with others.

#### 3. What questions will you ask your favorite employer at job interview?

1.  Your organization values its workers or employees, doesn't it?

2.  I want to know what challenges I might face in the job?

3.  It there any dress-code in your office?

4.  Have you got any special rules to order a working day?

#### 4. Give some advice on how behave at job interview to create a positive impression on the employer?

1.  I advise you to dress decently.

2.  You had better arrive on time.

3.  You should be confident

4.  I don't recommend asking silly questions.

#### 5. Some people think that it is necessary to have computer skills to get a good job. Do you agree with this?

Nowadays it's almost impossible to imagine any profession without global
communication, making presentations and doing many sorts of things on the
computer. And sure, you must be skillful enough to work with it. Your employer
will prefer to have a person who is potentially able to manage all these things.
