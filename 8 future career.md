# Future career

#### 1. Let's talk about yout future career. What kind of job would you like to have in future?

I must say that when you leave school you understand that the time to choose your future profession has come. It's not easy to make right choise of a job.

When you choosing a future career, we should consider different factors. Money is one fo the most important factors when you make a choice. There are well-paid jobs and low-paid jobs. I think everybody wants to earn as much money as possible.

Anyway, many people coose profession according to their interests and abilities. In my opinion, a job should be interesting and socially important. You should also decide if you want to work indoors or outdoors.

It goes without daying that you should take into account yout trits of character. For example, to become a good doctor you must be patient, caring and kind. Teacher's work requires love for children, good knowledge of subjects and ability to explain.

I have always been interested in informatics and I am good at mathematics. I have an abitities for working with people. So after finishing school I want to enter the university and study prigramming.

#### 2. Do you want to have a part-time job, when you are a student? Why(not)?

There are some disadvantages to having a part-time job when you are a student as well as some advantages. People often think that part-time jobs make a student pay less attention to the studies. In my opinion, having a part-time job teaches a student the importance of time management: that is combinig work and studies at the some time. Having a part-time job also teaches a person how to communicate adn interact with others.

Nowadays it's almost impossible to imagine any profession without global communication, making presentations adn doing many sort of things on the computer. And sure you must be skillful enough to work with it. Your employer will prefer to have a person who is potentially able to manage all these things.
